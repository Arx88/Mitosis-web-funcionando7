As the U.S. accelerates its transition to clean energy, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies must recognize — and navigate — dramatic industry shifts that can impact their solar construction business.
RenewableWorks, a TrueBlue Company that partners with EPCs and renewable energy contractors to support utility, commercial and community solar construction projects, identified these five trends for industry leaders to focus on for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.
TREND 1
Policy support and capital influx
The renewable energy industry is riding a powerful wave of regulatory support and unprecedented investment from the U.S. government. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in 2022 with a goal of substantially lowering the nation’s carbon emissions by 2030, allocates ne...

GLOBAL STATUS REPORT
Renewables in Energy Supply
2024
Investment and Finance
Global new investment in renewable power and fuels (not including hydropower projects larger than 50 megawatts, MW) reached a record high of an estimated USD 622.5 billion
i
in 2023.
1
Investment increased 8.1% from 2022, due largely to the global rise in solar photovoltaic (PV) installations.
2
These estimates do not include investment in renewable heating technologies, for which data are not collected systematically. Global investment in heat pumps
ii
fell 3.7% in 2023 to USD 63.1 billion, linked in part to consumer uncertainty around government policies and subsidies as well as to falling natural gas prices.

The Energy Transition in 2025: What to Watch For
The Energy Transition in 2025: What to Watch For
Progress powered on in 2024. What does that mean for the year ahead?
January 8, 2025
By
Will Atkinson
,
Chiara Gulli
As we enter a new year, the
race between tipping points
is clearer than ever. 2024 was likely the
hottest year on record
,
raising the risk
of
earth system tipping points
if we fail to speed up solutions.
But despite
warnings
of a
slowdown
, solutions continue to race forward. As cleantech becomes cheaper than ever, 2024 saw
record uptake
in renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and more. These
positive tipping points
are happening worldwide — with major progress in
China
and the
Global South
. Let’s review what that means for the year ahead.
Costs falling fast
. Solar module prices fell 35 percent to 9 cents per watt; EV batteries are now below $100/kWh and often at cost parity with their fossil-fueled competition.
Cleantech growing globally
. Solar ...
